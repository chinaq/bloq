- Implicit Binding: 
  - object has a property which equals to a function and within that functions body one can refer to other properties of that object with this.dotNotation
- Explicit Binding: 
  - binding using functionsâ€™ in-built functionality .call, .apply, .bind.
- New/Window Binding: 
  - when we use new to create an instance of an object, it binds the this keyword to itself within any of its methods/properties.
- ES2015 Arrow Functions
  - always use the value of `this` from the enclosing scope
